## Local Development

To run a local development server, you first need to install the dependencies:

``` bash
bun install
```

Then you can run the server:

``` bash
bun run docs:dev
```

This command will open a browser window that reloads each time you save, so you can see the changes in real time.

This documentation was built with [Vitepress](https://vitepress.dev/).
