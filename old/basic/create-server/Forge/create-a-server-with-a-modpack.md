:::tip
This page should only serve as a guideline for what to do with modpacks.  
Modpack creators often change how they create and manage server files, as such it is difficult to create guides for every possible type out there.  
If you need additional help or if your server files look different from what we have in this guide, visit our [discord server](https://www.mcserversoft.com/discord).
:::

## Step 1: Determine if you need custom startup settings

This is the first and most important step. We don't want to change settings if we don't need to.  
Download the server files from your preferred website, and unpack it in a folder **that's not inside of the MCSS /servers/ folder**.  
Then, check which case is yours:

- Server files don't contain any startup scripts (Good news! You can follow [the manual setup](/basic/create-server/Forge/create-forge-server-manually))
- Server files **ONLY** contain one or more .bat files (Go to [step 2](#step-2))
- Server files contains PowerShell scripts (`.ps1`, `.psm1`, `.psd1`, ... )  (Go to [step 3](#step-3))

## Step 2: Modpacks with .bat startup files {#step-2}

This is the part where we may need to edit the contents of the startup .bat file.  
Check the contents of your .bat file. Does it look like this? (If you have multiple of them, this section shouldn't apply to you)

```batch
REM Forge requires a configured set of both JVM and program arguments.
REM Add custom JVM arguments to the user_jvm_args.txt
REM Add custom program arguments {such as nogui} to this file in the next line before the %* or
REM  pass them to this script directly
java @user_jvm_args.txt @libraries/net/minecraftforge/forge/1.18.1-39.0.45/win_args.txt %*
pause
```

Good news! You can now follow the [manual setup, from the "importing the server in MCSS" section](/basic/create-server/Forge/create-forge-server-manually#migrate-the-server-to-mcss).  

If your bat file(s) do not look like that, you can search the file for the real startup line, which should be something on the lines of

```batch
java %ARGS% -jar server.jar %MC_ARGS%
```

We need to find the `%ARGS%` and `%MC_ARGS` variables, once you do, copy them over in a new, different file, replacing where they should be in the startup line.  
:::warning Run the default .bat file at least once!  
We still suggest running the default .bat file atleast once, as in some cases it will install or download necessary mods or libraries.  
It will also serve as an auto updater in most cases.  
:::
You can then import the server in MCSS, following [this guide](/basic/import-server/supported-server-files). **Make sure to select your newly created .bat file, and not the included one**.

## Step 3: Modpacks with PowerShell scripts {#step-3}

Open the `start.ps1` file. If you don't have one, it means that your modpack likely isn't covered by this guide.  
If you can see near the start of the file `Start script generated by ServerPackCreator`, you can go forward with this guide. If you don't see this, your modpack likely isn't covered by this guide.
Open the `variables.txt` file, and copy the values of the `JAVA_ARGS` and `ADDITIONAL_ARGS`.
Create a new `.bat` file, containing

```batch
java {JAVA_ARGS} -jar server.jar {ADDITIONAL_ARGS}
```

Replace the arguments with those you copied, without quotes and brackets.  
:::warning Run the default .bat file at least once!  
ServerPackCreator downloads and installs many requirements automatically. It is necessary to run it once.  
We suggest disabling the "java check" in the variables.txt, to avoid installing JABBA, which is not needed if you use MCSS.
:::
After this you can import the server in MCSS, following [this guide](/basic/import-server/supported-server-files). **Make sure to select your newly created .bat file, and not the included one**.
