Download it and install it. After it&#39;s done, make sure that it is running before clicking &quot;Yes, it&#39;s running&quot;.</p><p>Once the application is running, it will give you a &quot;Claim URL&quot; or a code to enter. Opening the claim URL will automatically add an &quot;Agent&quot; (a computer running the playit program) to your account.</p><p>The third step on the website is to just wait for the app to connect to the playit network. We&#39;ll wait for that before continuing.</p><p>At this point, your website should look something like this:</p><p><img src="'+i+'" alt="Full screen screenshot with the playit.gg onboarding process"></p><p>After that&#39;s done, you&#39;ll have to define the rules for the first tunnel.<br> Click on &quot;Create Tunnel&quot; to proceed.</p><p>From this point on, your setup may vary a little, depending on which port your server is using. In our case, we&#39;ll use the default 25565 port, but you may use a different one by changing it when necessary.</p><p>On this page, you can choose the type of tunnel you need (You should choose between Minecraft JAVA and BEDROCK in most cases, but TCP is also an option <a href="#using-playit-for-the-panel">should you need to use playit.gg for the web panel</a>)</p><p><img src="'+r+'" alt="Image of the playit tunnel configuration, in the &quot;shared IP&quot; tab, using the free region option and Minecraft JAVA option.
