## Making API calls {#-api-calls}

In order to make API calls you need special software. 


### Standalone Software {#-standalone-software}

Standalone software allow you to make API calls from a nice interface. These softwares support everything you need, from simple HTTP requests to advanced features like authentication.
<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="postman" label="Postman">Free forever, with unlimited calls and APIs. You can add up to three people to your team to share your work with them.
    You can download postman <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/">here</a><img src="../../img/docs/intro-api/postman.png"></img></TabItem>
  <TabItem value="insomnia" label="Insomnia">Free forever, with unlimited calls and APIs. you can share your work with as many people as you want.
  You can download Insomnia <a href="https://insomnia.rest/download">here</a><img src="../../img/docs/intro-api/insomnia.png"></img></TabItem>
</Tabs>


### IDE extensions {#-ide-extensions}

If you plan on writing code that leverages the API, you may want to use an IDE extension. Visual Studio Code being the most popular, here are a few options for it.

<Tabs>
  <TabItem value="rest client" label="Rest Client">This option is more hands-on, requiring you to write all your requests. But it gives you more control and a more concise interface. You can download it <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client">here</a><img src="../../img/docs/intro-api/rest-client.png"></img></TabItem>
  <TabItem value="thunder client" label="Thunder Client">The cleanest of the two options, with a dedicated window similar to Insomnia's UI. You can download this extension <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client">here</a><img src="../../img/docs/intro-api/thunder-client.png"></img></TabItem>
</Tabs>

<!-- 
<p>If you a standalone software, you can use <a href="https://www.postman.com/downloads/">Postman</a> or <a href="https://insomnia.rest/download">Insomnia</a>. Both are free and essentially do the same thing. </p>
<p>There are extensions for Visual Studio Code that can be used to make API calls, such as <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=humao.rest-client">Rest Client</a> and <a href="https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=rangav.vscode-thunder-client">Thunder Client</a>.</p>
