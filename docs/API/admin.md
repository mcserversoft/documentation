Admin is a very powerful permissions to grant. While it respects individual server access & permissions, it provides MCSS backend functionality to the User or API Key.

Introduced in `v13.5`, it grants access to user management tools like user creation, deletion and updating. The amount of functionality is limited, this will be expanded in the near future.
