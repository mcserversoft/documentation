Thank you for choosing **MC Server Soft**!

This documentation will help you get started with **MC Server Soft** (MCSS for short), the oldest maintained Minecraft server wrapper for Windows.

It is designed to make running Minecraft servers on your computer easy and efficient.

You can find information on how to install, configure, and use **MC Server Soft**, how to create your first server, as well as advanced topics like using the API, scheduling tasks, and more!

## A bit of history {#history}

**MC Server Soft** was launched in 2011 by [Fireblade](https://ko-fi.com/fiahblade) and he has been maintaining it ever since, adding more and more features over the years.

MCSS has grown from a simple server wrapper to a powerful tool that allows you to manage multiple Minecraft servers with ease.

If you want to support the development of MCSS, you can do so by [buying Fireblade a coffee](https://ko-fi.com/fiahblade)!

## What it is {#what-it-is}

**MC Server Soft** is a server wrapper for Minecraft that allows you to run and manage Minecraft servers on your Windows computer.

- It provides a user-friendly interface to create, configure, and manage your Minecraft servers without needing to manually edit configuration files.

- It supports multiple server types, including Vanilla, Spigot, Paper, and more.

- It also includes features like a remote panel to manage your servers from any device, a task scheduler to automate tasks, and an API for advanced users to interact with the servers programmatically.

- It is designed to be easy to use for beginners while also providing advanced features for experienced users.

## What it isn't {#what-it-is-not}

**MC Server Soft** is **not** a hosting service like Aternos or other Minecraft server hosting providers.

- It does not host your servers on the internet; instead, it runs them on your local computer. That means if your computer is turned off, your servers will not be accessible to anyone.

<!-- - It is a tool to help you manage your own Minecraft servers, giving you full control over the server files and configurations. -->

- It is not a replacement for Minecraft itself; you still need to have Minecraft installed on your computer to play on the servers you create with MCSS.
