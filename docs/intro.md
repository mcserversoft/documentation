# Getting started with MCSS

## Introduction {#-introduction}

MC Server Soft (aka MCSS) is a free server wrapper designed to help you run Minecraft servers on your computer.<br/>
It is not a hosting company like Aternos - the servers run on your computer.

MCSS is the oldest maintained Minecraft server wrapper for Windows.<br/>
It was launched in 2011 and is maintained by [Fireblade](https://github.com/fiahblade).

MC Server Soft is pronounced as "M C Server Soft".
