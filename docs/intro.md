## What is MC Server Soft {#what-is}

MC Server Soft (aka MCSS) is a free server wrapper designed to help you run Minecraft servers on your computer.

It is not a hosting company like Aternos - the servers run on your computer.

MCSS is the oldest maintained Minecraft server wrapper for Windows.

It was launched in 2011 and is maintained by [Fireblade](https://github.com/fiahblade).

MC Server Soft is pronounced as "M C Server Soft".

## Pre-requisites {#prerequisites}

In order to run and use MCSS, make sure your computer meets the requirements listed below:

* Windows 10/11 or Windows Server (2008 R2 SP1/2012/2016)
* A recent release of Java - Refer to our [java versions guide](/advanced/java-version) for more information

<!-- TODO: These are not prerequisites for running the server, should be in a different category -->
<!-- * Stable internet connection, wired is highly recommended
* Port forward capable modem/router (for online multiplayer) -->

:::warning Windows 7/8 users
While MCSS might run on Windows 8 and earlier, they are not officially supported.
We recommend you upgrade to Windows 10 or later for the best experience
