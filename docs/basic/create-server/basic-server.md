## What you need {#-what-you-need}

To create a simple server, you need the following:

- MCSS installed on your computer, in a folder where you have write permissions. **Do not run MCSS within the zip archive you downloaded**
- A server file, we recommend using `paper`. You can checkout the downloads and more information in the [Sourcing a server file](sourcing-server-file) section.
- The latest version of Java. Look at our [Java version guide](/advanced/java-version) for more information and download links.

:::info
If you want to create a Forge or Fabric server, please use the specific instructions :
[- For forge](/basic/create-server/Forge/create-forge-server)
[- For Fabric](/basic/create-server/Fabric/create-fabric-server-manually)

## Creating a server {#-creating-a-server}

1. Open MCSS and click on the **Create Server** button.
2. In the **Create Server** window, select the server type you want to create. For this guide, we will use **Paper**.

:::tip
If the srver type doesn't appear in the list (for example Neoforge) don't worry !
MCSS is still most likely capable of running it. Just select the "closest" available type (in this example Forge)
:::

3. Click on the **Select File** button to choose the server file you downloaded earlier.
4. Navigate to the folder where you saved the server file, select it, and click **Open**.
5. Enter a name for your server in the **Server Name** field.
6. Optionally, you can change the **Server Port** if you want to use a different port than the default (25565).
7. Click on the **Create** button to create the server.
8. Once the server is created, you will see it in the **Servers** list.
9. To start the server, select it from the list and click on the **Start Server** button.
