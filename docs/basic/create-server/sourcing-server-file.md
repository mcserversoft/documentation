## Getting a server file {#-getting-a-server-file}

When creating or updating a server you need to select a server jar.

The process of getting the server file can vary between server types. The usual options are:

* Downloading the **ready-to-use file** from official source
* Downloading the **installer file** or **build tool** from official source
* Downloading the **ready-to-use file** from a third party website

:::tip what are third party websites
Third party website uses these **installer files** or **build tools** to create the **ready-to-use files** in advance. These websites offer the files for free but display ads in return.
:::

How to use the **build tools** is not covered in this guide.
