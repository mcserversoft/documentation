There are many server types available. Here is a quick rundown of all of them.

## Vanilla Minecraft {#-vanilla-minecraft}

Vanilla is the name give to the version of the server software released by Mojang. It is the most basic version you can get, with no support for plugins or mods.
:::tip Use paper
Even if you don't want any plugins, we recommend you use [paper](#-plugin-support) as your server software as it adds some much needed performance upgrades and bug fixes

## Plugin support {#-plugin-support}

Plugins are third party add-ons you can add to your server. They can do a lot of different things, from fixing bugs to adding minigames or RPG-like gameplay.
