## Operating Systems {#os}

MCSS only runs on Windows operating systems. The following versions are supported and tested:

- Windows 10
- Windows 11
- Windows Server 2016
- Windows Server 2019
- Windows Server 2022
- Windows Server 2024

:::warning Older Windows Versions
While MCSS might run on Windows 8 and earlier, they are not officially supported.
We recommend you upgrade to Windows 10 or later for the best experience.
:::

## Java {#java}

Minecraft servers require Java to run. You will need a recent version of the Java Runtime Environment (JRE) installed on your computer.

We recommend using the most recent Long Term Support (LTS) version of Adoptium Java.

You can download it from [their website](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=windows&arch=x64&version=latest).

:::tip Java Versions
If you need to use a specific version of java, refer to the [Java Versions Guide](/advanced/java-version) for more information on how to set it up in MCSS.

## Playing online {#online-play}

To play with your friends online, you will need:

- A stable internet connection (wired is highly recommended)
- A port-forward capable modem/router (for online multiplayer)

:::warning Port Forwarding
Port forwarding is required for online multiplayer. If you are not familiar with port forwarding, please refer to your router's documentation or search online for guides specific to your router model.
