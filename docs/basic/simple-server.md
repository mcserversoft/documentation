## What you need {#requirements}

Before you get started, you will need to have downloaded MCSS from [mcserversoft.com](https://mcserversoft.com) and extracted the archive.

Minecraft uses java under the hood. To run a server you must have a recent version of the Java runtime installed on your computer.

If you haven't done so, head over to [adoptium](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/?os=windows&arch=x64&version=latest) to download and install java.
